@article{Haro2009,
abstract = {We present a methodology to compute power series expansions of parameterizations of invariant manifolds and of nor-mal forms of vector fields near an equilibrium. The described semi-numerical algorithms combine solving functional equations and au-tomatic differentiation techniques. As an application, we compute a high order approximation of the 4D center manifold of the L 1 Lagrangian equilibrium point of the Earth-Moon system. We explore the range of validity of this asymptotic expansions. We study the dynamics on the center manifold.},

@article{Simo2001,
abstract = {This book is a liber amicorum for Floris Takens in celebration of his 60th birthday. It was offered to him at the workshop Global Analysis of Dynamical Systems, held at the Lorentz Center of Leiden University in June 2001. This collection of contributions from long-timecollaborators, colleagues and friends of Floris constitutes an up-to-date document of central developments in Dynamical Systems that have emerged around his work.},
