abstract = {We present a methodology to compute power series expansions of parameterizations of invariant manifolds and of nor-mal forms of vector fields near an equilibrium. The described semi-numerical algorithms combine solving functional equations and au-tomatic differentiation techniques. As an application, we compute a high order approximation of the 4D center manifold of the L 1 Lagrangian equilibrium point of the Earth-Moon system. We explore the range of validity of this asymptotic expansions. We study the dynamics on the center manifold.},
