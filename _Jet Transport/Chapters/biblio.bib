In this edition, Beams Medal winner Charles Poole and John Safko have updated the text to include the latest topics, applications, and notation, to reflect today's physics curriculum. They introduce students to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics. Numerical exercises help students to develop skills in how to use computer techniques to solve problems in physics. Mathematical techniques are presented in detail so that the text remains fully accessible to students who have not had an intermediate course in classical mechanics.},

abstract = {There are ve equilibrium points to befound in the vicinity of two orbiting masses. They are called Lagrange Points in honour of the French-Italian mathematician Joseph Lagrange, who discovered them while studing the re-stricted three-body problem. The term restricted" refers to the condition that two of the masses are very much heavier than the third. Today we know that the full three-body problem is chaotic, and so cannot be solved in closed form. Therefore, Lagrange had good reason to make some approx-imations. Moreover, there are many examples in our solar system that can beaccurately described by the restricted three-body problem. r 1 r 2 M 1 M 2 r m Figure 1: The restricted three-body problem The procedure for nding the Lagrange points is fairly straightforward: We seek solutions to the equations of motion which maintain a constant separation between the three bodies.

@article{Haller2011,
abstract = {We develop a mathematical theory that clarifies the relationship between observable Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) and invariants of the CauchyGreen strain tensor field. Motivated by physical observations of trajectory patterns, we define hyperbolic LCSs as material surfaces (i.e., codimension-one invariant manifolds in the extended phase space) that extremize an appropriate finite-time normal repulsion or attraction measure over all nearby material surfaces. We also define weak LCSs (WLCSs) as stationary solutions of the above variational problem. Solving these variational problems, we obtain computable sufficient and necessary criteria for WLCSs and LCSs that link them rigorously to the CauchyGreen strain tensor field. We also prove a condition for the robustness of an LCS under perturbations such as numerical errors or data imperfection. On several examples, we show how these results resolve earlier inconsistencies in the theory of LCS. Finally, we introduce the notion of a Constrained LCS (CLCS) that extremizes normal repulsion or attraction under constraints. This construct allows for the extraction of a unique observed LCS from linear systems, and for the identification of the most influential weak unstable manifold of an unstable node. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Shadden2005,
abstract = {This paper develops the theory and computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), which are defined as ridges of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields. These ridges can be seen as finite-time mixing templates. Such a framework is common in dynamical systems theory for autonomous and time-periodic systems, in which examples of LCS are stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points and periodic orbits. The concepts defined in this paper remain applicable to flows with arbitrary time dependence and, in particular, to flows that are only defined (computed or measured) over a finite interval of time. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of FTLE fields and the associated LCSs for revealing the Lagrangian behavior of systems with general time dependence. However, ridges of the FTLE field need not be exactly advected with the flow. The main result of this paper is an estimate for the flux across an LCS, which shows that the flux is small, and in most cases negligible, for well-defined LCSs or those that rotate at a speed comparable to the local Eulerian velocity field, and are computed from FTLE fields with a sufficiently long integration time. Under these hypotheses, the structures represent nearly invariant manifolds even in systems with arbitrary time dependence. The results are illustrated on three examples. The first is a simplified dynamical model of a double-gyre flow. The second is surface current data collected by high-frequency radar stations along the coast of Florida and the third is unsteady separation over an airfoil. In all cases, the existence of LCSs governs the transport and it is verified numerically that the flux of particles through these distinguished lines is indeed negligible. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.
