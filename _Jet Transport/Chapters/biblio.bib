@article{Haro2009,
abstract = {We present a methodology to compute power series expansions of parameterizations of invariant manifolds and of nor-mal forms of vector fields near an equilibrium. The described semi-numerical algorithms combine solving functional equations and au-tomatic differentiation techniques. As an application, we compute a high order approximation of the 4D center manifold of the L 1 Lagrangian equilibrium point of the Earth-Moon system. We explore the range of validity of this asymptotic expansions. We study the dynamics on the center manifold.},

@misc{Goldstein2007,
abstract = {For thirty years this has been the acknowledged standard in advanced classical mechanics courses. This text enables students to make connections between classical and modern physics. In this edition, Beams Medal winner Charles Poole and John Safko have updated the text to include the latest topics, applications, and notation, to reflect today's physics curriculum. They introduce students to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics. Numerical exercises help students to develop skills in how to use computer techniques to solve problems in physics. Mathematical techniques are presented in detail so that the text remains fully accessible to students who have not had an intermediate course in classical mechanics.},

@article{Cornish1998,
abstract = {There are ve equilibrium points to befound in the vicinity of two orbiting masses. They are called Lagrange Points in honour of the French-Italian mathematician Joseph Lagrange, who discovered them while studing the re-stricted three-body problem. The term restricted" refers to the condition that two of the masses are very much heavier than the third. Today we know that the full three-body problem is chaotic, and so cannot be solved in closed form. Therefore, Lagrange had good reason to make some approx-imations. Moreover, there are many examples in our solar system that can beaccurately described by the restricted three-body problem. r 1 r 2 M 1 M 2 r m Figure 1: The restricted three-body problem The procedure for nding the Lagrange points is fairly straightforward: We seek solutions to the equations of motion which maintain a constant separation between the three bodies. If M 1 and M 2 are the two masses, and {\~{}} r 1 and {\~{}} r 2 are their respective positions, then the total force exerted on a third mass m, at a position {\~{}} r, will be {\~{}}},
